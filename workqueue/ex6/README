The first step is actually creating some work to defer. To create the structure statically at run-time,use DECLARE_WORK:

DECLARE_WORK(name, void (*func)(void *), void *data)


This statically creates a work_struct structure named name with handler function func and argument data

Now that the work is created, we can schedule it.  To queue a given work's handler function with the default worker threads, simply call

schedule_work(&work);
