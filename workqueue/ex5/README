Queued Work is executed when the worker thread next wakes up. Sometimes, you need to ensure that a given batch of work has to be completed before continuing. This is especially important for modules, which almost certainly want to call this function  before unloading.

For these needs, there is a function to flush the given work queue.

void flush_scheduled_work(work);


This function waits untill all the entries in the queue are executed before returning.

Any work that is scheduled via schedule_delayed_work() , and whose delay is not yet up, is not flushed via flush_scheduled_work().
